# CiteClaw

**Transparent, high-fidelity literature acquisition for autonomous scientific discovery.**

CiteClaw is a composable snowballing agent that constructs systematic research corpora
from a handful of seed papers. It traverses the global citation graph with a circuit-style
pipeline of rule-based, similarity-based, and LLM-based filter blocks — tiering cheap
checks before expensive LLM screening to deliver survey-grade collections at remarkably
low cost, with full provenance at every step.

In a recent benchmark mapping the evolution of AI4Biology, CiteClaw screened **18,000+
candidates** in 30 minutes and extracted **400+ milestone papers** (2% acceptance rate)
with high precision and recall — at a total cost of **$0.70** using Gemini 3 Flash-Lite.

## Why CiteClaw

Autonomous scientific discovery with LLM agents hinges on rigorous understanding of
frontier literature. Today, building survey-grade research corpora is a punishing manual
bottleneck, while existing LLM-based tools trade rigor for efficiency, producing opaque,
hallucination-prone knowledge bases that scientists cannot trust for high-stakes work.

CiteClaw is built to be the trustworthy substrate for the next generation of autonomous
research — from hypothesis generation and experiment planning to fully self-driving labs.

Key design principles:

- **Circuit-style composition** — `nn.Sequential`-inspired pipeline of pure signal
  transformers, with a `Parallel` branch primitive for independent exploration.
- **Tiered filtering** — YearFilter → CitationFilter → SimilarityFilter → LLMFilter,
  so expensive LLM calls only see pre-screened candidates.
- **Full provenance** — every paper's acceptance path is tracked; run state, shape
  summaries, and rejection counts are persisted to disk.
- **Community-aware reranking** — graph- or embedding-based clustering can drive
  diversity-aware top-K selection.
- **S2 SPECTER2 out of the box** — semantic similarity and topic modeling read
  Semantic Scholar's precomputed vectors; no embedding backend setup required.
- **Cost-conscious** — batched LLM dispatch, read-through SQLite cache, and
  cheap-first filter ordering push per-paper cost to cents.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .

# optional: UMAP+HDBSCAN topic modeling
pip install -e '.[topic_model]'

# optional: dev tooling (ruff, mypy, pytest)
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

### Environment

Set your API keys in a `.env` file (or export them directly):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY=...   # optional, improves S2 rate limits
```

---

## Quick start

1. Write a `config.yaml` describing reusable filter blocks and a linear list of
   pipeline steps. See `config_bio.yaml` for a full biology example, or
   `test_config.yaml` for a minimal one.

2. Run CiteClaw:

```bash
python -m citeclaw -c config_bio.yaml
```

3. Continue a prior run (adds another expansion generation on top of the existing
   collection):

```bash
python -m citeclaw -c config_bio.yaml --continue-from data_bio/
```

4. Annotate the resulting citation graph with LLM-generated node summaries:

```bash
python -m citeclaw annotate data_bio/citation_network.graphml -c config_bio.yaml
```

CLI flags: `--topic`, `--seed`, `--data-dir`, `--max-papers`, `--model`, `-v`,
`--continue-from`.

## Architecture at a glance

Two compositional layers, mirroring `nn.Sequential` plus a parallel branch.

| Layer            | Operates on                 | Composition primitives                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline (steps) | `signal: list[PaperRecord]` | top-level Sequential, `Parallel`                                          |
| Filter blocks    | one paper → bool            | `Sequential` (AND), `Any` (OR), `Not` (invert), `Route` (if/elif/else)    |

Every step is a pure signal transformer:

```python
class BaseStep(Protocol):
    name: str
    def run(self, signal: list[PaperRecord], ctx: Context) -> StepResult: ...
```

`ctx.collection` is the cumulative union of every paper ever accepted; only `ReScreen`
removes from it. `Rerank` is **non-destructive** — it filters the signal but never
touches `ctx.collection`. This invariant lets `Parallel` work: one branch can
rerank-then-forward while another sees the original input untouched.

### Pipeline steps

| Step              | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LoadSeeds`       | Initialise `ctx.collection` from `seed_papers`. Emits the seeds as the first signal.                 |
| `ExpandForward`   | For every paper in the signal, fetch citers, screen them, add the survivors to collection + signal.  |
| `ExpandBackward`  | Same as ExpandForward but follows references instead of citers.                                       |
| `Rerank`          | Score-based top-K (with optional cluster-aware diversity). Non-destructive — only filters the signal. |
| `ReScreen`        | Apply a screener block to the entire `ctx.collection` (minus seeds), removing rejected papers.        |
| `Cluster`         | Run a clusterer over the signal once, store the `ClusterResult` in `ctx.clusters[<store_as>]`.        |
| `MergeDuplicates` | Detect and merge preprint↔published duplicates via DOI/ArXiv ID + title sim + SPECTER2 cosine.        |
| `Parallel`        | Broadcast the signal to N branches, run each independently, union outputs by `paper_id`.             |
| `Finalize`        | Write `literature_collection.json` / `.bib`, `citation_network.graphml`, `run_state.json`.            |

### Filter blocks

| Type                | Purpose                                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sequential`        | AND of `layers:` (plural). Short-circuits on first reject.                             |
| `Any`               | OR of `layers:` (plural). Short-circuits on first pass.                                |
| `Not`               | Invert a single child block specified as `layer:` (singular).                          |
| `Route`             | if/elif/else dispatch over `routes:`.                                                  |
| `SimilarityFilter`  | Max of normalized scores from `measures:` list (RefSim / CitSim / SemanticSim).        |
| `YearFilter`        | Pass if `year` is in `[min, max]`.                                                     |
| `CitationFilter`    | Pass if citation count is high enough relative to `beta` and paper age.                |
| `LLMFilter`         | Batched LLM screening; `scope:` is `title` / `title_abstract` / `venue`. Single-prompt or Boolean formula mode. |

### Clusterers

| Type          | Mechanism                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `walktrap`    | igraph `community_walktrap` over the citation graph; targets a fixed `n_communities`.  |
| `louvain`     | igraph `community_multilevel` (modularity maximisation); auto-determines count.        |
| `topic_model` | UMAP + HDBSCAN over S2 SPECTER2 embeddings. BERTopic-inspired, no bertopic dep.        |

Cluster naming (label / summary / keywords / representative papers) is filled in by an
algorithm-agnostic post-processor using c-TF-IDF and/or LLM calls — the same code labels
a walktrap community and a topic_model topic identically.
